### **2. Test Complete Setup**
```bash
# Verify everything works
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm test         # Run all tests
npm run lint     # Run linting
npm run test:e2e # Run Playwright smoke tests
```

### **3. Begin Phase 2 Implementation**
- Extract game loop logic from `GameRefactored.js`
- Implement entity pooling in `EntitySpawner`
- Add spatial partitioning to `CollisionDetector`
- Enhance input mapping in `InputHandler`
- Optimize audio management in `AudioManager`

### **4. Set Up Unity Project**
