# Contributing to TotTrots Game Refactored

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the TotTrots Game Refactored project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
4. **Run tests**: `npm test`
5. **Run linting**: `npm run lint`

### Development Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main` or `develop`
2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
3. **Write tests** for new functionality
4. **Run the test suite** to ensure everything passes
5. **Run linting** to check code quality
6. **Commit your changes** with descriptive messages
7. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request

### Code Standards

- **ESLint**: All code must pass ESLint checks
- **Prettier**: Code should be formatted with Prettier
- **Tests**: New features must include tests
- **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed
- **Type Safety**: Use JSDoc for type annotations

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test changes
- `chore`: Build/tooling changes

Examples:
```
feat(gameplay): add new power-up system
fix(ui): resolve mobile layout issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Project Structure

### Web Canvas Prototype

npm run test:e2e
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Write integration tests for system interactions
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

## Pull Request Process
